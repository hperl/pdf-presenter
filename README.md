PDF Presenter
=============

A simple Cocoa-Application to present PDF-slides in a smart way. 

PowerPoint and Keynote both have a presentation mode, but what happens if you like to do your slides in LaTeX (or only have a PDF-version of the slides)? This application aims at providing a nice PDF presentation mode including

- fullscreen only on the second monitor
- current slide and next slide (preview) on the primary monitor

I also plan features like annotation support for slide notes and a timer.

Feedback is welcome!
